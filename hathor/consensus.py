    The consensus algorithm uses the metadata voided_by to set whether a block or transaction is executed.
    If voided_by is empty, then the block or transaction is executed. Otherwise, it is voided.

    The voided_by stores which hashes are causing the voidance. The hashes may be from both blocks and
    transactions.

    The voidance propagates through the DAG of transactions. For example, if tx1 is voided and tx2 verifies
    tx1, then tx2 must be voided as well. Another example is that, if a block is not in the bestchain,
    any transaction spending one of the block's outputs is also voided.

    In the DAG of transactions, the voided_by of tx1 is always a subset of the voided_by of all transactions
    that verifies tx1 or spend one of tx1's outputs. The hash of tx1 may only be on its own voided_by when
    tx1 has conflicts and is not the winner.

    When a block is not in the bestchain, its voided_by contains its hash. This hash is also propagated
    through the transactions that spend one of its outputs.

    Differently from transactions, the hash of the blocks are not propagated through the voided_by of
    other blocks. For example, if b0 <- b1 <- b2 <- b3 is a side chain, i.e., not the best blockchain,
    then b0's voided_by contains b0's hash, b1's voided_by contains b1's hash, and so on. The hash of
    b0 will not be propagated to the voided_by of b1, b2, and b3.

        """ This method is called only once when a new block arrives.

        The blockchain part of the DAG is a tree with the genesis block as the root.
        I'll say the a block A is connected to a block B when A verifies B, i.e., B is a parent of A.

        A chain is a sequence of connected blocks starting in a leaf and ending in the root, i.e., any path from a leaf
        to the root is a chain. Given a chain, its head is a leaf in the tree, and its tail is the sub-chain without
        the head.

        The best chain is a chain that has the highest score of all chains.

        The score of a block is calculated as the sum of the weights of all transactions and blocks both direcly and
        indirectly verified by the block. The score of a chain is defined as the score of its head.

        The side chains are the chains whose scores are smaller than the best chain's.
        The head of the side chains are always voided blocks.

        There are two possible states for the block chain:
        (i)  It has a single best chain, i.e., one chain has the highest score
        (ii) It has multiple best chains, i.e., two or more chains have the same score (and this score is the highest
             among the chains)

        When there are multiple best chains, I'll call them best chain candidates.

        The arrived block can be connected in four possible ways:
        (i)   To the head of a best chain
        (ii)  To the tail of the best chain
        (iii) To the head of a side chain
        (iv)  To the tail of a side chain

        Thus, there are eight cases to be handled when a new block arrives, which are:
        (i)    Single best chain, connected to the head of the best chain
        (ii)   Single best chain, connected to the tail of the best chain
        (iii)  Single best chain, connected to the head of a side chain
        (iv)   Single best chain, connected to the tail of a side chain
        (v)    Multiple best chains, connected to the head of a best chain
        (vi)   Multiple best chains, connected to the tail of a best chain
        (vii)  Multiple best chains, connected to the head of a side chain
        (viii) Multiple best chains, connected to the tail of a side chain

        Case (i) is trivial because the single best chain will remain as the best chain. So, just calculate the new
        score and that's it.

        Case (v) is also trivial. As there are multiple best chains and the new block is connected to the head of one
        of them, this will be the new winner. So, the blockchain state will change to a single best chain again.

        In the other cases, we must calculate the score and compare with the best score.

        When there are multiple best chains, all their heads will be voided.
